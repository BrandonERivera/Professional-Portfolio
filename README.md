# Professional-Portfolio

### User Story:

I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

This Portfolio is to be used and updated gradually throughout the classes, including my different works that I have done and filling out the Portolio is the goal so other can look at my accomplishments.
